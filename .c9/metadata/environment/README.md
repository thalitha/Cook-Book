{"changed":true,"filter":false,"title":"README.md","tooltip":"/README.md","value":"# Cook Book\n \nIt is an online cook book web page where users can search for recipes. There are also options to upload, edit and delete recipes .\nEveryone likes to enjoy good food and cooking itself is a major worldwide hobby, so obviously a website like this has a big chance to be popular.\n\n\n### UX\nThe website is designed to be extremely straight forward, the general search field in the middle of the homepage where the user see's \"search for a recipe\" highlights to them that there is a simple but advanced search engine available to them. There is no clutter on the homepage, no distractions, its designed so it is not confusing and grabs the user very quickly.  So in this search engine, the user can enter words like chicken, fish, meat or whatever to find what they are looking for, which will obviously bring up another page with the results. \nAfter looking at the homepage for another few seconds one of the next things the user will see is “Search by Category” option, this is the second search field and it too is very clear and simple to use.  there are 3 categories here called: “Dish”, “Type of Cuisine” and “Type of Diet”. Searching by categories can be useful for those who don’t have something straight in mind, but has some preferences as to type of dish or/and type of cuisine, and/or also diet restrictions (Type of Diet).  \nThe website also has more 5 pages called: “Big Trends”, “About Us”, “Connect with Us”, and “Upload a Recipe” “Edit & Delete Recipe” which will be described in great detail on the “Features” section below in this document.\n\n\n### Features\nTop Nav Bar \nFirst is the option for the “Cook Book” which just brings you back to the homepage and the main search engine as described above.  Next they will see the “Search by Category” also described above.\nThe next Top Nav Bar options are “Big Trends”, “About Us”, “Connect with Us” and “ Recipe Management” which opens a dropdown list which gives a further two options: “Upload your Recipe” and “Edit & Delete a Recipe”.\n\n* ***First Page***  \nOn the first page, in the middle of the screen there is the general search field where the user should type the keyword of the recipe desired and click on the button “Search”\n* Search by Category page\nOn the Search by Category page the user should flag/select as many categories he/she wants and click on the button “Search” at the bottom. Above the Search button there is a display for the total amount of recipes available which will appear in the next page based on the current fields that are flagged.\nListed below are the options under each category:\n“Dish”: Chicken, Fish, Pasta, Meet and Dessert\n“Type of Cuisine”: Italian, French, Thai and Greek\n“Type of Diet”: Vegan, Vegetarian, Light and Gluten-Free\n-Recipes Resulted from the Search page\nThis page displays the recipes which meets the criteria flagged on the search (whether they were from the General Search or Search by Category). In this page each recipe will be named and will provide a picture. Each recipe clearly has a “See More” option highlighted in blue allowing the user to go in and view, when the user clicks on this they will get all the information required in order to prepare the dish, including time needed, ingredients required, detailed preparation instructions and also a picture of the dish. \n* Big Trends\nOn the Big Trends page it shows pictures of 3 deluxe dishes (in a carrocel format)\n* About Us\nOn this page the user can find out a little about the company that created the page and it’s purpose. It is on this page that the cooking knives are mentioned and promoted.\n* Connect with Us\nThis simply shows that we are on the three major social media channels, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter. \n* Recipe Management\nBy clicking on Recipe Management, it will open a dropdown box with the option to go to the pages: “Upload your Recipe” and “Edit & Delete a Recipe”.\n* Upload Your Recipe page\nAllows the user to upload his/her own recipe.

They enter the Name of the Recipe, Time required, Ingredients required, Preparation details, and category details.  Upload a Picture and at the end click on the “Send” button. Then the “           Save” button will appear in green.\n* “Edit & Delete a Recipe” page \nWill display all recipes available on the website, by name and with a picture and will have the options to “Edit” and “Delete” for each. The “Edit” page is essentially the same as the “Upload page” but obviously the text is already populated. \n \n### Future plans include:\n* An option to register, login and log out. \n* Provide profile information for logged in members with graphics about how many recipes he/she has uploaded (and also a breakdown of them by category), and how many were deleted. How the recipes that he/she uploaded have performed (how many likes has received).\n* Provide detailed pages about knives and accessories for sale and provide purchase options.\n* An option for members who upload numerous recipes receive 10% discounts of the knives.\n\n### Testing\nAll features of the website has been tested and seems to be working well.\nWhen the users start to write the name of the city the autocomplete functionality give options to select the city. \nBy clicking in each of them the user will be able to see a list of options of each, and the respective spots (location tags) on the map, and\nfrom the result list the user is able to click on the place indicated and it will show the name, address and website.\nThe webpage is responsive adapting to different sizes of the devices.\nThe xxx validator coding was used.\n \n### Deployment\nthe webpage was deployed using Github and the link to the website is: xxxx \n?????\n \n### Credits\nContents:\nI accessed: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/places-autocomplete-hotelsearch\n \n### Acknowledgements:\nI would like to thank you my mentorn very capable  who even spent extra hours to help t0 direct me.\n\n\n\n-----\nUX\n\n\n\n\nTesting\nAll features of the website have been vigorously tested and everything is in order.\nI run scrip tests for the functionalities.
