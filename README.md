# Cook Book
 
It is an online cook book web page where users can search for recipes. There are also options to upload, edit and delete recipes .
Everyone likes to enjoy good food and cooking itself is a major worldwide hobby, so obviously a website like this has a big chance to be popular.


### UX
The website is designed to be extremely straight forward, the general search field in the middle of the homepage where the user see's "search for a recipe" highlights to them that there is a simple but advanced search engine available to them. There is no clutter on the homepage, no distractions, its designed so it is not confusing and grabs the user very quickly.  So in this search engine, the user can enter words like chicken, fish, meat or whatever to find what they are looking for, which will obviously bring up another page with the results. 
After looking at the homepage for another few seconds one of the next things the user will see is “Search by Category” option, this is the second search field and it too is very clear and simple to use.  there are 3 categories here called: “Dish”, “Type of Cuisine” and “Type of Diet”. Searching by categories can be useful for those who don’t have something straight in mind, but has some preferences as to type of dish or/and type of cuisine, and/or also diet restrictions (Type of Diet).  
The website also has more 5 pages called: “Big Trends”, “About Us”, “Connect with Us”, and “Upload a Recipe” “Edit & Delete Recipe” which will be described in great detail on the “Features” section below in this document.

The next Top Nav Bar options are “Big Trends”, “About Us”, “Connect with Us” and “ Recipe Management” which opens a dropdown list which gives a further two options: “Upload your Recipe” and “Edit & Delete a Recipe”.

In this page each recipe will be named and will provide a picture. Each recipe clearly has a “See More” option highlighted in blue allowing the user to go in and view, when the user clicks on this they will get all the information required in order to prepare the dish, including time needed, ingredients required, detailed preparation instructions and also a picture of the dish.
