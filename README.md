# Holiday Planning
 
It is an online cook book web page which allows the users to search for recipes. There are also options to upload, edit and delete the recipes .
Cooking is an amazing experience, at least for some people, and everyone likes to enjoy a good food, so surely it is an interesting website.

### UX
The website is very straight-forward and the user has 2 ways to perform the searches, first is just by tying the name of the recipe desired on the general search field, in the first screen; and second, search for recipes by categories, in the second screen.
On the page “Search by Category”, there are 3 sessions called: “Dish”, “Type of Cuisine” and “Type of Diet”. Searching by categories can be useful for who doesn’t have something straight in mind, but has some preferences as type of dish or/and type of cuisine, and/or also diet restrictions (Type of Diet). 
The website also has more 5 pages called: “Big Trends”, “About Us”, “Contact Us”, “Recipes Resulted from the Search” and “Upload a Recipe” “Edit & Delete Recipe” which will be described in great detail on the “Feature” session in this document.

### Features
